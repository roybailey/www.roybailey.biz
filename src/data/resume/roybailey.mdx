educationSummary: "
My passion for software coding started at the age of 9.
Entering an Apprenticeship straight after high school I was quickly talent spotted
and poached by a local independent software house.
My commercial success since then speaks for itself.
In fact, not being able to rely on a Computer Science Degree
has given me extra drive to constantly learn and challenge myself,
and that diversity has given my employers the benefit of my broader commercial strengths.
